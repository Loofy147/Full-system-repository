# Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the 14-week phased implementation plan for the Système Multi-Ecosystem Architecture.

---

## Phase 1: Foundational Setup (Weeks 1-2)

**Goal:** Establish the core infrastructure and address critical P0 repository issues.

-   **Week 1: Core Architecture Deployment**
    -   [ ] Deploy the initial Python implementation of the 4-layer architecture.
    -   [ ] Set up a centralized logging and monitoring system.
    -   [ ] Begin building the Governance Gateway for `outonomos-system`.

-   **Week 2: Critical Repository Upgrades**
    -   [ ] **P0:** Complete the initial build of the Governance Gateway (`outonomos-system`).
    -   [ ] **P0:** Begin upgrading the linear UVFA in `Herarchecal-agent` to a neural network.
    -   [ ] **P1:** Archive the `November-` repository and unify its configuration into `Agents-box-comunication`.

---

## Phase 2: Integration and Governance (Weeks 3-6)

**Goal:** Integrate the first set of repositories and enforce governance policies.

-   **Week 3: Orchestration and Communication**
    -   [ ] Integrate `Agents-box-comunication` with the Layer 1 Orchestration Router.
    -   [ ] Begin removing interactive prompts from `Intellectual-intelligence.-`.

-   **Week 4: HRL and Autonomy**
    -   [ ] Complete the neural network upgrade for `Herarchecal-agent`.
    -   [ ] Integrate `Intellectual-intelligence.-` with the Governance Gateway for HITL.

-   **Week 5: First Wave of Red Team Testing**
    -   [ ] Deploy the Red Team Engine in a staging environment.
    -   [ ] Execute all "Injection" and "Resource Exhaustion" attack scenarios from the playbook.
    -   [ ] Triage and prioritize vulnerabilities.

-   **Week 6: Resilience and Stability**
    -   [ ] Integrate `AutoGPT` with the Layer 4 Resilience patterns.
    -   [ ] Remediate all P0/P1 vulnerabilities discovered during Red Team testing.

---

## Phase 3: Ecosystem Expansion (Weeks 7-10)

**Goal:** Integrate the remaining active repositories into the architecture.

-   **Week 7: Simulation and Modeling**
    -   [ ] Integrate `agent-based-modeling` and `Agent-simulation` with the Red Team Engine.
    -   [ ] Expose `a-star-search-algorithm` as a discoverable service.

-   **Week 8: Visualization and Evaluation**
    -   [ ] Connect `aframe-a-painter-fork` to the dashboard.
    -   [ ] Integrate `agenta` to consume vulnerability reports from the Red Team Engine.

-   **Week 9: Advanced Multi-Agent Systems**
    -   [ ] Integrate `AgentVerse` with the Governance Gateway.
    -   [ ] Connect `agi-in-a-box` to the HRL Manager for experimental algorithm testing.

-   **Week 10: Second Wave of Red Team Testing**
    -   [ ] Execute all "State Fuzzing", "Protocol Manipulation", and "Governance Bypass" attack scenarios.
    -   [ ] Triage and prioritize all new vulnerabilities.

---

## Phase 4: Optimization and Self-Improvement (Weeks 11-14)

**Goal:** Harden the system, optimize performance, and enable continuous self-improvement.

-   **Week 11: Performance Tuning**
    -   [ ] Optimize the performance of the HRL Manager and Orchestration Router.
    -   [ ] Remediate all remaining vulnerabilities from Red Team testing.

-   **Week 12: Dashboard and User Experience**
    -   [ ] Complete the interactive dashboard with real-time Red Team controls.
    -   [ ] Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with stakeholders.

-   **Week 13: Final Red Team Campaign**
    -   [ ] Execute all "Model Poisoning" and "Evasion Attack" scenarios.
    -   [ ] Perform a full, end-to-end penetration test of the entire system.

-   **Week 14: Go-Live and Continuous Improvement**
    -   [ ] Officially launch the Système Multi-Ecosystem Architecture.
    -   [ ] Establish a continuous improvement process based on the ACE Playbook and Red Team findings.
    -   [ ] Schedule quarterly Red Team campaigns to ensure ongoing security.
